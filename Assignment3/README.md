#### Instruction: For the unit 3 create a program that will create a 3 dimensional objects. You can use the cube, sphere, or torus knot for this assignment. Your program must display the object within the scene. Your object should be scaled such that it only covers a small portion of the viewing area.
You must animate the object by making it move across the viewing space. When the object reaches the limit of the viewing port it must change direction (think of it as a ball that is bouncing around in a box)
